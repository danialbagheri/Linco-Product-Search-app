## Linco Product Search app

This is a small one page search to make API calls to Linco Care rest APIs.

This is app completely independent and uses VUE framework to query the data from Linco Care api.

To get started, install all the NPM dependency packages by typing:

```
npm install
```

For Development: setup WebPack development server on your system but installing it globally:

```
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```

For production modify the webpack config file to production, rebuild the files by running `webpack` in your terminal. (`webpack-cli` needs to be installed) and finally copy the `dist` to your server.
